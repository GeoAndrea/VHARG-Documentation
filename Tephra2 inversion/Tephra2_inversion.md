# Tephra2 inversion on the cluster

Tephra2 inversion is on Komodo at `/home/volcano/Tephra2Inversion/`.

Basically follow Seb's procedure!: https://e5k.github.io/codes/utilities/2018/06/06/inversion/

If there are permissions errors in the log files (output as default to your home account at ~/jobno.komodo2.des.OU), then either copy the folder to your home account and run there, or ask Edwin to fix your permissions in /home/volcano.
